# ssgen
Shadowsocks config generator

This is a small utility for generating a simple .json configuration for your shadowsocks server/client.
For options please refer to [shadowsocks documentation](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki). 

To run either download the self-contained executable from [releases](https://github.com/mfat/ssgen/releases) section or download the python script directly and run with 
```python ssgen.py```
